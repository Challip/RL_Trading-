'Bitcoin' and cryptocurrencies have seen a significant rise in interest worldwide with the idea that crypto could change the way people use, save, and transfer 
their assets. The dramatic rise in crypto prices in the past years approaches many people to invest in them. However, the trading market is not simple, 
and even the most experienced trader can end up losing a substantial sum of money in only a few minutes. 
The use of algorithms in trading allows investors to avoid emotional and irrational decisions while making profits using modern technology.
Developing a profitable trading strategy is critical to algorithmic trading since the algorithm is responsible for managing and executing automated trading decisions. 
Fortunately, the application of reinforcement learning to algorithmic trading has shown promising results in recent years.
This project implement the processes of applying reinforming learning to algorithmic trading to successfully gain profit in the crypto market.
